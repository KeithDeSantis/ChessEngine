# ChessEngine

This is a personal project I've been doing in my free time, trying to create the infrastructure for a simple chess engine, and possibly add updated functionality and AI down the line.

## Construction

The program makes uses of a couple design patterns, namely the singleton pattern which is used for the gameboard and a comprehensive history of moves that is kept for reference.

## Gameplay

The UI and UX is currently very rough and only done through ASCII as I focus on the backend and consturction of the engine, but I may update it in time.
